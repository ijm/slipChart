Schedule slip charts in python

I first saw this kind of chart in a nice [www.edwardtufte.com forum thread][http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=000076&topic_id=1&topic=Ask%20E%2eT%2e] about project managment
charts. Specificaly the NASA Launch schedule slip chart in the wiki.

The slipOrig directory produces slip charts with a 45 degree time line as in the origonal, along
with anotations and footnotes.

The slipVert directory produces slip charts with a vertical time lines, and anotations (but no footnotes).

This code, and these reproductions are intended to engender discusion, so I have, for now, used an MPL license. If this is too restrictive let me know.
