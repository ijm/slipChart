# slipChart
Schedule slip charts in python. Also sometimes called milestone reports.

I first saw this kind of chart in a nice [www.edwardtufte.com forum thread](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=000076&topic_id=1&topic=Ask%20E%2eT%2e) about project management
charts. Specifically the NASA Launch schedule slip chart in the [Wiki](https://github.com/ijm/slipChart/wiki)

The slipOrig directory produces slip charts with a 45 degree time line as in the original, along
with annotations and footnotes.

The slipVert directory produces slip charts with a vertical time lines, and annotations (but no footnotes).

This code, and these reproductions are intended to engender discussion, so I have for now, used an MPL license. If this is too restrictive let me know.

And yes the code is a bit ropey in places.
